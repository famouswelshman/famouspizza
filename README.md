# Purpose of this project â€“ Milestone 4

This project idea was based on a common e-commerce website where user has the ability to view pizza related food products, register their details and process a transaction for payment of the items to be delivered.

Users can view all website content but cannot select and/or process an order without first registering their account, login in to their account and setting up payment details in order for payment to be made and the delivery process to be initiated.

The website will include details of products by category and include tags , making the process of search much easier for the user.

The user can view their cart content and be able to add or remove to their order before confirming payment transaction .

# VALIDATION

# Code Validation
## HTML
HTML code for all pages passed through W3C Markup Checker shows some warnings and errors in relation to Jinja templating. I have also been made aware of some divs which
remain open but closing these completely corrupts the display of the containers, something I learnt late in the project before submit.
